#                                           Welcome to the OpenMacBuild project




This project is being developed by me, to improve and simplify the usual user in finding the files he needs, such as the loader (OpenCore) or Kexts.


Now I'll tell you a little about the capabilities of this program:



OpenMacBuild is almost completely automatic, you just need to select the desired action, for example, we need a kext for them the master version of AppleALC or VirtualSMC, we run the program like a regular other App, it opens in text form, a terminal with a very simple menu.

And we see five items 1: Kexts to Release, 2: Kexts to Debug, 3: Release loader, 4: Debug loader and other files fifth point, for our task we need the first point, go there and see multiple choices, we select the third point: collect the Kexts we need.

The build process will be automatic, MacBuild nano appeared on the desktop and all the files we need will be there.

There is also a fully automatic mode, it collects the loader with all its files in the directory and a set of kexts, it is in the third in the second subparagraph.



To be fully functional, Xcode 11.7 must be installed, Xcode 12.X is also supported.


To enable the debug mode of the program, you must specify -Debug, currently available only in the test version.
